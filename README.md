Combines Hard Drive and Performance - Disk widgets into 1. Allows 2 different disk widgets to be active at a time.

Shows CPU temperature in the Performance - CPU widget.

GPU Widget shows GPU utilization %, GPU Temp and Fan Power %.

VRAM Widget shows % of allocated video memory.

Most of these changes depend on HWINFO 5.10 being installed and this plugin being available:  https://www.hwinfo.com/files/RainmeterPlugin/HWiNFO_3.2.0.rmskin

A lot of the config was done using ids from my own HWInfo shared data. It is unlikely that cpu temp, gpu and vram info will work for anyone else without some custom changes.

Thanks @TJ Markham for this awesome library!
